# project_palm_api

## Purpose Thusfar
This is an API built using PHP to support the authentication & creation of users.

## End Goal
This api will support all necessary functions of our project palm react-native app.

## Reusability
Likely none, unless you really love the way I write my PDO statements

## Missing Files?
All information related to authenticating on our server and the generation of tokens has been excluded from github, for rather obvious reasons.
